Where we're at:

java.lang.RuntimeException: com.maxmind.geoip2.exception.AddressNotFoundException: The address 127.0.0.1 is not in the database.

This is for registration. I can't get the registration to work because it claims not to know what this local address is. Doesn't hit my if Statement in DeviceService.

If I disable it locally, it's working. I'll have to fix.

Now I'm getting an error with authentication of java mail sender.

Created an app-specific password for Java Mail Sender, and it's working.

The app got some cleanup and fixes.

I can login, but I get an invalid character error when trying to access the home page.
